ðŸ“Š Telangana Weather Insights Dashboard in Power BI

ðŸŽ¯ Problem Statement
Understanding weather patterns is crucial for various sectors, including agriculture, disaster management, and urban planning. There was a need for a unified and interactive platform to analyze historical weather data (rainfall, temperature, humidity, and wind speed) across different districts and timeframes to identify trends, anomalies, and relationships between various weather parameters.

ðŸ¥… Project Goals

To analyze total and monthly rainfall distribution by district and year.
To visualize rainfall trends over multiple years for different districts.
To identify average minimum and maximum temperatures across districts and analyze annual and monthly temperature trends.
To understand humidity patterns, including daily, monthly, and annual trends, and identify anomalous humidity days.
To analyze wind speed patterns, including average monthly and annual trends, and identify extreme wind speed events.
To explore relationships between rainfall, temperature, humidity, and wind speed.
To identify seasonal patterns for all weather parameters.

Key Insights:

* Rainfall analysis provides detailed distribution by district and month, highlighting historical trends and annual percentages.
* Temperature insights offer a comprehensive view of average minimum and maximum temperatures, along with their monthly and annual trends, aiding in understanding temperature variations.
* Humidity patterns are thoroughly analyzed, showing daily, monthly, and annual fluctuations, and pinpointing days with unusual humidity levels.
* Wind speed analysis covers average, extreme, and seasonal wind patterns, which is vital for forecasting and risk assessment.
* The comprehensive insights dashboard integrates all weather parameters, displaying their individual trends, interrelationships, and seasonal variations, providing a holistic view of the weather dynamics.

Recommendations:

* Further investigation into the identified "Anomalous Days" for humidity and "Extreme wind speed in each district" could reveal underlying climatic factors or local influences.
* The relationships between different weather parameters (e.g., rainfall and temperature) can be further explored to build predictive models for specific districts.
* Utilize the seasonal patterns identified for each weather parameter to develop more accurate seasonal forecasts and prepare for potential weather-related events.
* The detailed district-level data can assist local authorities in developing targeted strategies for agriculture, water management, and disaster preparedness.
